      <title>Skolt Sámi</title>
      <p>There is a rudimentary analysis of Skolt Sámi available. It has now been added to the cvs.</p>
      <p>Skolt Sámi has alternation processes that more often than not involve several graphepes at the same time. Thus, Skolt Sami differ from the other languages in having xfst rather than twolc as the basic format for its rule file.</p>
      <p>The Skolt Sámi written language is the one with the highest number of modified Latin letters. Due to technical limitations when the Skolt Sámi parser was worked on, it is still written in the Latin 1 encoding, with digraphs for the Skolt Sámi letters (e.g. <em>g1, g2</em> for <em>ǧ, ǥ</em>, etc. as can be read out of the alphabet listing in the xfst-sms.txt file). Renewed work on Skolt Sámi should thus start by moving it to UTF-8.</p>
