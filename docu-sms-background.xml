      <title>Skolt Sámi</title>
      <p>There is a rudimentary analysis of Skolt Sámi available. It has now been added to the cvs.</p>
      <p>Skolt Sámi has alternation processes that more often than not involve several graphepes at the same time. Thus, Skolt Sami differ from the other languages in having xfst rather than twolc as the basic format for its rule file.</p>
